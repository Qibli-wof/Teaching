#in my honest thougt, it is quite creative, not even i would come up with piping output of input()
#but its not the most efficient way of doing this, as the list and the dictionary are seperated, not allowing for any compatability if you were to add bigger features in the future
#that would be my response to a normal developer working at a company, but youre new and this is great work for your level! of course it has much to go but it runs, already better than expected
# taking into account your skill level and the quality of code, id give it a 8/10, id have given a 9 if the comments were better but it is still quite good!
